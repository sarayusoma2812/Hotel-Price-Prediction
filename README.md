# Hotel Price Prediction
 
## 1. Introduction

The hospitality industry relies heavily on data-driven insights to make informed decisions, optimize pricing strategies, and enhance customer experiences. This project aims to develop a predictive model for hotel room prices using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques for the cleaning process and linear regression to build the model. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of historical hotel bookings and their associated features, we leverage EDA to gain insights into the relationships between variables and identify key factors influencing room prices.

## 2. Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize the power of data analysis to build a predictive model for hotel room prices. We aim to understand the complex relationships within hotel pricing data through effective data analysis techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## 3. Methodology

### a. Data Collection
We sourced our dataset from the expansive [Data World Repository](https://data.world/), which offers a wealth of information relevant to our project objectives. This dataset comprises 29 columns and more than 74,000 records, including attributes such as property type, amenities, room type, accommodates, number of bathrooms, cleaning fee, cancellation policy, city, review score rating, and more.

### b. Data Exploration and Cleaning

We conducted thorough data preprocessing, including handling missing values, error rectification, outlier management, and feature engineering. This phase involved transforming categorical variables into numerical representations and standardizing datetime formats for temporal analysis.

### c. Data Analysis and Visualization

We employed various visualization techniques such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to explore price distributions, correlations between variables, and city-wise metrics comparisons. These visualizations provided valuable insights into pricing patterns, regional influences, and temporal trends within the dataset.

### d. Predictive Modeling

For predictive modeling, we utilized machine learning algorithms such as Linear Regression, XGBoost, and AdaBoost. These models were trained and evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error, Mean Square Error (MSR), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R2 score to assess their performance in predicting hotel room prices accurately.

## 4. Research Questions

How do the hotel's cancellation policies and instant booking options relate to the number of guests checking in?
Can a host's longevity in the hospitality business be linked to their willingness to verify their identity and showcase a profile picture?
Determine which attributes exhibit the most substantial impact on predicting hotel prices.
Explore the influence of room type and accommodation capacity on pricing.
Investigate the relationship between host-related attributes and pricing.
Determine whether there is an association between the type of bed provided in listings and their pricing.
Analyze the correlation between the number of amenities offered and pricing.
Explore how review scores and the number of reviews impact pricing.

## 5. Conclusion

In conclusion, this project demonstrates the significance of EDA in understanding complex relationships within hotel pricing data. By combining effective data analysis techniques with machine learning, the model provides valuable insights and predictions that can be harnessed by the hotel industry to optimize pricing strategies and enhance customer experiences.
